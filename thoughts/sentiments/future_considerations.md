## ORM not Raw SQL

- Use an ORM like SQLAlchemy instead of doing raw queries

## Implement More Possible Solutions

## Dive Deeper

- Add the ability to preview the individual log files when selecting the time graph

## Natural Language Sentiments

- Use a LLM to query the findings and gather unique insights through natural language
