# Lessons Learned

## Time Spent Planning is Crucial

Through this process of documenting and planning:

- I am foreseeing many stumbling points in the project. 

- Taking a broader view of how the system could work before building it, and making better descisions as a result

- Managing expectations

- Creating a more realistic vision of how development will occur

## Tooling is Everything

As much as this documenting is cool, there is a lot of friction in my current process. I decided to do .md and symlinks to make it easy to navigate the whole document from github, but as a result I am spending a lot of time simply creating folders and files, organising them, writing out link paths, renaming link paths(what a nightmare it will be if I want to reorganise anything). 

As such, using an open source tool like [logseq](https://logseq.com) for my own internal documentation, and potentially interall company documentation synced through github would cut down on that friction. This can save a great deal of time with any planning, discussion and documentation going forward, with an increasing return on investment as templates, conventions and tooling around the tooling gets developed.

## Plan out Your Architecture!

Figuring out how all the components will function and communicate is crucial. By taking a birds eye view of the system before and while building it, you are able to see and make descisions on how to effectively manage and structure modules and their communication flows. This has many benefits I a can think of:

- Avoid potential pitfalls through foresight

- More intentional execution through design limitations and requirements

- Can focus on scalability from the start

- Avoids major refactors, once you set the rules you don't break them

## Set Aside Time for Learning

When approaching this project, there were quite a few things I didn't know about. I decided to try and bypass the learning step, and use the knowledge of an AI to make descisions for me. Instead of doing it this way, I simply should've set aside a day when planning, to learn all the concepts I was unfamiliar with or flat out didn't know, in this case that would be react and time series.

## It's Okay to Get Stuck Sometimes

We will all reach challenges which at the time may seem insurmountable, and you may even fail when faced with it. But what matters is that you try again, delete your days/months of progress if you have to. Every failure is a teaching moment if taken right. In this case, I learnt not to rely on someone elses thinking without fully understanding the underlying concepts myself.
