# Lessons Learned

## Time Spent Planning is Crucial

Through this process of documenting and planning:

- I am foreseeing many stumbling points in the project. 

- Taking a broader view of how the system could work before building it, and making better descisions as a result

- Managing expectations

- Creating a more realistic vision of how development will occur

## Tooling is Everything

As much as this documenting is cool, there is a lot of friction in my current process. I decided to do .md and symlinks to make it easy to navigate the whole document from github, but as a result I am spending a lot of time simply creating folders and files, organising them, writing out link paths, renaming link paths(what a nightmare it will be if I want to reorganise anything). 

As such, using an open source tool like [logseq](https://logseq.com) for my own internal documentation, and potentially interall company documentation synced through github would cut down on that friction. This can save a great deal of time with any planning, discussion and documentation going forward, with an increasing return on investment as templates, conventions and tooling around the tooling gets developed.
