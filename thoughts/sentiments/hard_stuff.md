# Stuff I Found Hard

- ## Data Science
  
  - Wow there are a seemingly inumerable amount of concepts :()
  
  - What I'm finding hard specifically right now is finding the best solution while tying my best not to get lost in the weeds and spending weeks just learning data science...

- ## Not Enough Planning
  
  - I thought that considering my deadline, I should not spend more than the two days I spent planning. But this ended up wasting almost a whole day when I decided to introduce the log_analyser_tools.py interface, and then refactoring it back into log_analyser.py
  
  - Should've considered the architecture some more
  
  - I was impatient to start building, and thought I had planned enough
  
  - Next time it's important to take enough time planning

- ## Inexperience
  
  - Because I'm not used to building, especially in python, things are taking a bit longer than I'd like because I'm really having to deliberate, learn and fix while implementing.
  
  - I'm sure that as I build more and more, things will get a lot quicker

- ## Setting up Frontend
  
  - I have never used react before, as well as just in general never really having worked with websites at all
  
  - This is a topic I definetely need to revisit as I basically know nothing
