# Stuff I Learned

- ## Data Science
  
  - Obviously I didn't learn the whole field, some people spend their whole lives on this topic. All I'm saying is this is my first formal and practical encounter with the subject.
  
  - I've grasped a basic outline of how it works, basically it just seems to be a lot of math, specifically statistics and relational concepts.
  
  - My current approach, use the algorithms developed by people way smarter than me, and don't really try to learn and understand it too in depth, just get it working.

- ## React
  
  - I've never worked with react before, just spun it up and winged it hoping to get something functional
  
  - I can see how it's structured, just need to spend some time learning it's core concepts
