# Stuff I Found Easy

- ## Parsing
  
  - I'm already quite experienced loading, saving and parsing data
  - With the help of AI as a junior developer with me, I was able to speed up the process of writing this code

- ## Control Flow
  
  - I feel really comfortable understanding control flow, especially if I'm allowed to break a program up

- ## Working
  
  - I find great joy in building and challenging my mind
  
  - Finding solutions to issues and challenges is what excites me and fullfills me
  
  - Even when I get discouraged, I always enjoy that feeling because I know I'm challenging my weaknesses
