# Monday

# 06:47

- Took yesterday as a break
  
  - This was good, it really allowed me some time for reflection

- I'm really behind schedule, need to make sure I follow my priorities properly and don't get sidetracked again

- Going to start the day with: 
  
  - some quick refactors
  
  - finishing the testing for frequency analysis
  
  - introducing the frontend

- Added some more of the [things I struggled with](../sentiments/hard_stuff.md) to sentiments

# 06:50

- Going to quickly merge log_analyser_tools.py and log_analyser.py, there is no need for these two to be seperate

# 07:12

- Just finished moving the code over to one place and doing some simple refactors
  
  - That was really quick and easy

- Now to start with tests for the frequency analysis

# 07:32

-  Just seperated the inject_filters() function into individual components, as I noticed that it was doing more than one thing, which is a no no
  
  - Seperation of concerns

# 08:16

- Just been fixing all the errors from restructuring, about to finish the test for basic analysis

# 08:30

- Finished up writing mock up tests, my testing right now is not thorough, but I just wanted to get it in and move on. 
  
  - I'll have to come back and revist the tests when I'm done for the week

- Just created a next.js project, I'll be using this as my frontend because:
  
  - React/Js is the industry standard for web apps
  
  - I don't want to spend too much time creating a niche thing, the frontend is just a drop in which can be replaced at any time

- I'm going to use fastapi for the server
