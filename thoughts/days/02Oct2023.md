# Monday

# 06:47

- Took yesterday as a break
  
  - This was good, it really allowed me some time for reflection

- I'm really behind schedule, need to make sure I follow my priorities properly and don't get sidetracked again

- Going to start the day with: 
  
  - some quick refactors
  
  - finishing the testing for frequency analysis
  
  - introducing the frontend

- Added some more of the [things I struggled with](../sentiments/hard_stuff.md) to sentiments

# 06:50

- Going to quickly merge log_analyser_tools.py and log_analyser.py, there is no need for these two to be seperate

# 07:12

- Just finished moving the code over to one place and doing some simple refactors
  
  - That was really quick and easy

- Now to start with tests for the frequency analysis

# 07:32

- Just seperated the inject_filters() function into individual components, as I noticed that it was doing more than one thing, which is a no no
  
  - Seperation of concerns

# 08:16

- Just been fixing all the errors from restructuring, about to finish the test for basic analysis

# 08:30

- Finished up writing mock up tests, my testing right now is not thorough, but I just wanted to get it in and move on. 
  
  - I'll have to come back and revist the tests when I'm done for the week

- Just created a next.js project, I'll be using this as my frontend because:
  
  - React/Js is the industry standard for web apps
  
  - I don't want to spend too much time creating a niche thing, the frontend is just a drop in which can be replaced at any time

- I'm going to use fastapi for the server

# 09:24

- Just got the client side up and running, but I'm out of time for now

- Have never created a next.js/react.js app before, so I'm just trying my best to learn and build at the same time
  
  - Was choosing next a mistake? Nah I don't think so, as long as I don't waste the day just trying to get it set up

- I need to focus on pattern and temporal analysis today.

- Will leave the UI for later

# 09:27

- Signing off for now

# 11:02

- Just got back, it's before 12, so I'm going to try and see if there is a way to quickly knock out this frontend

- Found this no code [UI Builder](https://mui.com/toolpad/getting-started/overview/), might be just what I need
  
  - The frontend is not that important, it can and should be replaced once this tools actually gets integrated into the business workflows

# 12:28

- Trying to use this [Web Page Builder](https://teleporthq.io)
  
  - Going to take some time to get things right

- I'm going to move on to working on the pattern and temporal analysis, as I'm wasting time trying to get the frontend setup(I'm not really a UI guy)
  
  - Added this sentiment to [things I struggled with](../sentiments/hard_stuff.md)

# 12:33

- Created the [Risk Assessment](../documents/functional_breakdown/risk_assessment.md) document to make a descision on how to do pattern analysis

# 12:37

- I am looking into the [possible solutions](../documents/functional_breakdown/possible_solutions.md) for pattern matching, starting out with removing the ones which I don't feel good about or just seem unreliable or like they'll give me issues

# 12:42

- I have now laid out what seem to be valid approaches in the [Risk Assessment](../documents/functional_breakdown/risk_assessment.md)

- Since I don't really know any of these algorithms, their tradeoffs and strengths, I'll plug my design specifications, database implementation into a gpt. and then reason on which sub-method for each of the methods would be best, and then compare the chosen sub-methods to pick one best method to actually implement

- Hopefully this goes quick

# 12:53

- Just took a quick break, I'm back now

# 13:18

- Just got a list of 5 possible approaches.
  - From what I can tell, log data tends to be unpredictable. As such, having several different types of analysis for any given subject could be benefitial, and testing is definitely required

# 13:32

- Updated [New Things I Learned](../sentiments/learned_stuff.md), [Lessons Learned](../sentiments/lessons.md) and [Future Considerations](../sentiments/future_considerations.md)

- Going to deliberate with gpt to find the best solution now

# 14:04

- Just created the [Viable Solutions](../documents/functional_breakdown/risk_assessment/viable_solutions.md), [Chosen Solution](../documents/functional_breakdown/risk_assessment/chosen_solution.md), and [Tokenisation Implementation](../documents/functional_breakdown/risk_assessment/tokenisation_implementation.md) documents under the [Risk Assessment](../documents/functional_breakdown/risk_assessment.md) document
- As such I have chosen **tokenisation** for my pattern analysis approach
- If I find time, I'd like to also include more implementations, but I'll hold off considering I'm off schedule

# 14:08

- I will now implement the pattern analysis algorithm

# 14:23

- I've broken down the functions needed for tokenisation, and added them to the [Kanban](https://tree.taiga.io/project/jayfalls-log-analyser)
- I'm just going to start building and see what happens

# 15:15

- I have the tokenisation class set up

- Just working on implementing querying from the database for all the logs

# 15:56

- I just implemented all the tokenisation and pattern analysis from that

- I'm not quite sure how it works, so I'm just going to do a bunch of tests on it to understand exactly how the process works
  
  - This is a side affect of trying to do this quick and dirty, without actually learning too much about how these things work.

# 16:34

- I'm now questioning if I made the right decision

- I'm struggling to get it to work, and the fact that I don't even know what I'm doing is adding to that frustration

- I'm out of time for now, so I'm going to have to do more research on pattern analysis to try and figure this one out

# 16:42

- From some quick research, it's looking like maybe I'll have better luck with a time series approach

- Will investigate further when I have some time

# 18:13

- Just got back

- Don't have time left, so I'll just update my sentiments with what I learned today

# 18:18

- Updated [Lessons Learned](../sentiments/lessons.md) and [Easy Stuff](../sentiments/easy_stuff.md) with my takeaways from today
