# Thursday

# 12:05

- Just returned from my daily duties and got my laptop started up

- Going to settle in and start work on the MVP

# 12:16

- I am now starting to do research on some MVP templates, as well as having some back and forth discussion with an llm to structure and formulate this document.

# 12:30

- I have decided that the scale of the project is too small for an MVP, with the design document serving most details.

- I will now update the design document to be more comprehensive

# 12:49

- I have decided to leave the design document alone

- I have now created the [Functional Breakdown](../documents/functional_breakdown.md)
  
  - In creating this document, I am trying to conceptually solve the challenges presented by the [Design Document](../documents/design_document.md)

# 13:13

- I am busy working on the [Possible Solutions](../documents/functional_breakdown/possible_solutions.md) to the [Required Functions](../documents/functional_breakdown/required_functions.md)

- I have arrived at the first point of the Advanced Analysis section of the [Design Document](../documents/design_document.md), and am coming to realise that pattern analysis is very broad, and there are many ways to achieve varying solutions

- I am spotting a potential time sink in integrating these many possible solutions, as each one could take an hour to days, depending on bugs and gaps in my knowledge

- I have never had to do data science before, so this is completely new to me, to avoid being overwhelmed and getting lost down a rabbit hole, I will decide on the 2-3 best solutions I can find to pattern identification, with a list of future types to add beyond my current deadline. 

- I will look into Data Science fundamentals and start learning about it later in the day when I have some free time.

# 13:46

- Just finished brushing over some possible solutions to the pattern analysis requirement

- I'm struggling with a bit of analysis paralyses with all of these new concepts, but I'm just going to discuss with an llm and use my best judgement to try and identify the most easily implementable and effective solution

- Just created the [Learned Stuff](../sentiments/learned_stuff.md) document

# 13:59

- I am finding that creating the [Functional Breakdown](../documents/functional_breakdown.md), it's really helping me to understand the scope and challenges of this project.
  
  - I feel more confident on making realistic timeline assumptions for the AGILE document as a consequence of this 
  
  - I feel more confident in meeting the deadline
  
  - Helped me to identify gaps in my knowledge required for this project, talking about you **DATA SCIENCE** :)

# 14:38

- I've finished the outline for possible_solutions.md
- I'm noticing that I might not have time to implement any code today, but I am happy that I am taking this time to document and plan, it's really helping me to break down this program into manageable sections, and I think it will go a long way to helping me develop smoothly

# 14:55

- Added [Lessons Learned](../sentiments/lessons.md)

# 15:04

- I was initially considering adding implementation decisions into the [Functional Breakdown](../documents/functional_breakdown.md), but decided that it would be a waste of time, and I would rather start work on the AGILE document, and then code. 
  
  - This is also more how I would handle this process in a team setting, as each indivual team members will have their own ideas on how to solve the problem, and it's up to each engineer to engineer.
  
  - On second thought, there could also be benefit to planning the exact implementation with the input of all engineers to deliberate the best solution, especially for larger and more complex projects where architecture will matter more and more in the long run
  
  - It depends on the context

# 15:10

- I will now start work on the AGILE document

# 15:16

- I am putting all the documents I have made so far into gpt, to develop my AGILE plan

# 15:33

- I have laid out most of the [AGILE](../documents/agile.md) document
- I am searching for a decent Kanban software for you guys to visually see my task progress, and to obviously track my progress too with a fancy to-do list.

# 15:40

- I have decided on [Taiga](https://taiga.io) as my kanban because it is:
  
  - Open-Source
  
  - Has shareable links without requiring sign in
  
  - Sleek design

- Going to figure out how it works quickly so I can lay out the plan

# 15:47

- Finished the [AGILE](../documents/agile.md) document

# 16:00

- Load shedding

- I'm taking a break

# 18:25

- Ended up cleaning through load shedding

- Laptop died

- This is where I'm closing off for today, will use the spillover time([Game Plan](../documents/game_plan.md)) tomorrow morning to set up the kanban
