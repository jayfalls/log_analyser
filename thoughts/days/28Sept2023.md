- I have recieved a basic [design document](./documents/design_document.md) for a log analyser from Lytehouse.
- I just created this github repo and layed out the basic file structure.

# 17:36

- Firstly I will message Jean with a confirmation and access to this repo.
- I will then start to do research on all of the requirements of the design document, lay out a plan for the MVP, how I envision my timeline, as well as my plan as to how I should document my thoughts efficiently.

- Just returned from personal obligations and had to fix my laptop charger which just broke. I am now settling back into my task
- I need to do research for the MVP, roughly plan my timeline and figure out my documentation process

# 19:48

- I will now start deliberating all of these topics one by one, starting with my documentation process

# 19:52

- Thought Documentation Process
  
  - I've decided to keep all documents text based, markdown. This is to ensure easy and consistent access for review
  
  - I will have one main map of content folder to act as the documentation index
  
  - I've decided on seperating the days into its own folder, with .md files specifying each day of work. 
  
  - I will have an extra folder for any documents I need or generate. 
  
  - And another folder for my general sentiments over the course of the project
