# Thursday

# 08:31

- Starting my day off

- I think I'm going to spend today trying to get anomaly, temporal and pattern recognition working

- And then tomorrow I'll spend for polish, docs and finalising the thought docs

# 08:47

- Just starting off with some quick code cleanup

# 09:14

- So for pattern detection I'm seeing an easy way to find patterns between log_types is to simply compare which frequencies over time match

- And for anomaly detection, is to remove these matching occurences, and just to have the unique occurences show

- I'm quickly going to remove the filter that takes out all [REPORTING] log types to see if maybe something useful can be gleamed from that
  
  - This just makes the data really messy, so nope

- Also I should plot a different graph for sources over time

# 10:38

- Okay I just cleaned up the code a bunchm which should make navigating it a breeze, it was a bit overwhelming before
  
  - Still more to do on this front

- Going to start working through the [Kanban](https://tree.taiga.io/project/jayfalls-log-analyser)

# 10:56

- Just did some final cleanups and small bug fixes

- Will start with all the pattern and anomaly stuff now
