# Thursday

# 08:31

- Starting my day off

- I think I'm going to spend today trying to get anomaly, temporal and pattern recognition working

- And then tomorrow I'll spend for polish, docs and finalising the thought docs

# 08:47

- Just starting off with some quick code cleanup

# 09:14

- So for pattern detection I'm seeing an easy way to find patterns between log_types is to simply compare which frequencies over time match

- And for anomaly detection, is to remove these matching occurences, and just to have the unique occurences show

- I'm quickly going to remove the filter that takes out all [REPORTING] log types to see if maybe something useful can be gleamed from that
  
  - This just makes the data really messy, so nope

- Also I should plot a different graph for sources over time

# 10:38

- I added the function to display sources over time

- I just cleaned up the code a bunch which should make navigating it a breeze, it was a bit overwhelming before
  
  - Still more to do on this front

- Going to start working through the [Kanban](https://tree.taiga.io/project/jayfalls-log-analyser)

# 10:56

- Just did some final cleanups and small bug fixes

- Will start with all the pattern and anomaly stuff now

# 11:11

- Busy working on anomaly detection, firstly with that function that separates the non matching occurences into its own time series

# 12:04

- Just got that working with the function get_mismatched_frequencies(), was pretty easy, pandas basically did all the heavy lifting for me

# 12:10

- Taking a break

# 13:14

- Just got back

- Going to work on visualising anomalies on the main graph

# 13:24

- Been looking through the code and graphs quickly

- Feeling kind of tired, going to make coffee 

# 13:28

- Been thinking about how I can handle the anomaly and pattern overlays on the graphs, and how this will be handled by the interface
  
  - So I'm thinking of jut doing it how I've handled the normal plots, which is through the DatabaseAnalyser class.
  
  - Using this class I'll draw the initial plots as I'm already doing, then do any pattern or anomaly inference in class, and pass one big dictionary over to the visualiser class to append any changes.

# 14:01

- Working on refactoring the visualiser class to be more moduler, so that can make adjustments to plot over several functions

- LOAD-SHEDDING :(

# 14:08

- Even worse, it's not load-shedding, but a random outage, hopefully the power comes back soon 
  
  - Battery will only last for about 1 hour of work...
  
  - Then I'll have to charge with the mini-ups

# 14:11

- Awesome **IT'S BACK** luckily

# 15:14

- I'm finished making the code modular and fixing bugs
  
  - That was a decent sized refactor

- Going to get anomaly visualisation up and running now

# 15:37

- Awesome, it's really crude right now, but I have all the mismatch anomaly points displaying correctly

# 15:47

- Fixed the random line style generator not working

- I'm happy with this, going to go take a swim, will be back soon

# 16:15

- Have to take care of responsibilities, will return later
