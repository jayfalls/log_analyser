- Good Morning new day!

- I've decided that today, I'm just going to start off by learning.
  
  - If I had done this as part of my planning, I probably would've saved a day or two. But you live and learn
  
  - I usually use youtube videos as my main learning tool, with google and chatting with an ai with further questions as supplements to that
  
  - The reason I *SKIPPED* the learning is because I assumed that the solution wouldn't be on youtube, and that I'd have to figure it out myself. I almost **ALWAYS** use youtube when I'm approached with unfamiliar concepts.
  
  - This way I get to learn and understand the concepts within my own framing, not just copy pasta like I did yesterday

# 07:01

- So a quick check on patterns and I'm finding all these great videos:
  
  - [Fundamentals of Data Science with Python: Finding Patterns with Descriptive Statistics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VohdcwGLVnw)
  
  - [Finding Patterns & Outcomes w/ Time Series Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBVQvVCZPCM)
  
  - [Automatically Find Patterns & Anomalies from Time Series or Sequential Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvaBPSeA_JA)

- And in searching for those videos, I found these great Python playlists that I will elevate my python skills for sure(gonna go through these when I'm done with this project):
  
  - [Software Design in Python](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC0nd42SBTaNuP4iB4L6SJlMaHE71FG6N)
  
  - [Architecture & Cloud](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC0nd42SBTaO3aajVi2FomC86q6TeRM_Y&si=JtQFm571HKe8mcwa)
  
  - [Software Testing](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC0nd42SBTaPYSgBqtlltw328zuafaCzA&si=h_5yRqswOlhVbZTp)
  
  - Yes these playlists are all from the same guy, but I've seen his videos before and I like his way of sharing knowledge as well as him being a python expert, so I know I'll get value from all these playlists

# 07:07

- Im going to start with the pattern videos and see if I can get it implemented.

# 07:17

- So as I was starting this video: 
  [Fundamentals of Data Science with Python: Finding Patterns with Descriptive Statistics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VohdcwGLVnw), I noticed it's a whole playlist of really short videos:
  [Fundamentals of Data Science with Python](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTgRMOcmRb3MHWbS838mwbNqGGEgbmym8)
  
  - I'm going to go through the whole playlist to get a high level overview
  
  - And then this similiar playlist from the same channel:
    [Time Series Analysis with Python](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTgRMOcmRb3MpykLdyTwi9B1tLU9_KdEF)

# 07:26

- Deleting all my work from yesterday

# 07:31

- So starting off with this playlist: [Fundamentals of Data Science with Python](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTgRMOcmRb3MHWbS838mwbNqGGEgbmym8), I'm being introduced to numpy

- Multi-dimensional arrays, **cool**, but maybe a bit overkill for what I need, just going to keep going, because it's definitely a good intro for me as someone who knows basically nothing of data science

# 07:43

- Now getting into matplotlib

- I usually do things like this, learn from videos and then apply my knowledge
  
  - I guess because I was trying to look smart and skip this learning process, but it just ended up making me look silly and wasting time
  
  - I'm definitely not making this mistake again

# 07:47

- I'm currently printing out my frequency of log types to the terminal
  
  - Going to quickly introduce a visualisation class and swap over to using a matplot bar graph instead of printing to terminal

# 08:08

- Created analysis_visualiser.py

- My database queries result in an output with lists of items as they are related to each other, but to plot as graphs they need to be seperate in a dimensional array

- As such I'm writting a function to do this in my AnalysisVisualiser class

# 08:42

- I have it implemented, but am having issues with my miniconda environment for some reason, *fun*

# 08:51

- Just deleted my miniconda install, it's working yay

- Gonna go back to studying now

# 08:56

- Fixed a bug where the frequencies werent ordered correctly
