- Good Morning new day!

- I've decided that today, I'm just going to start off by learning.
  
  - If I had done this as part of my planning, I probably would've saved a day or two. But you live and learn
  
  - I usually use youtube videos as my main learning tool, with google and chatting with an ai with further questions as supplements to that
  
  - The reason I *SKIPPED* the learning is because I assumed that the solution wouldn't be on youtube, and that I'd have to figure it out myself. I almost **ALWAYS** use youtube when I'm approached with unfamiliar concepts.

- So a quick check on patterns and I'm finding all these great videos:
  
  - [Fundamentals of Data Science with Python: Finding Patterns with Descriptive Statistics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VohdcwGLVnw)
  
  - [Finding Patterns & Outcomes w/ Time Series Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBVQvVCZPCM)
  
  - [Automatically Find Patterns & Anomalies from Time Series or Sequential Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvaBPSeA_JA)

- And in searching for those videos, I found these great Python playlists that I will elevate my python skills for sure(gonna go through these when I'm done with this project):
  
  - [Software Design in Python](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC0nd42SBTaNuP4iB4L6SJlMaHE71FG6N)
  
  - [Architecture & Cloud](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC0nd42SBTaO3aajVi2FomC86q6TeRM_Y&si=JtQFm571HKe8mcwa)

- Im going to start with the pattern videos and see if I can get it implemented.
