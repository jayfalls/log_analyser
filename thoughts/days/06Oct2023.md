- Good morning world!

- Ready to knock all the small things out today

# 06:40

- I'm going to start with finalising the visualisation of the anomaly detection I worked on yesterday

# 07:37

- Awesome, that was pretty easy

- Moving on to pattern recognition now

# 08:22

- So getting pattern matching between log type graphs was really simple

- Now to move on to temporal analysis, still haven't exactly figured out what I'm doing here, going to think about it and do research if necessary

# 10:59

- Wow, I'm stuck right now, trying to figure out the best way to display patterns

# 11:40

- Okay, I really tried but I'm struggling to come up with anything extra

- Gonna try and crank out a GUI quickly to make the program more usable

# 12:53

- Just knocking this gui out

# 14:09

- Decided to really go minimal with the gui as I've run out of time

# 14:43

- Adding input to adjust the analysis
