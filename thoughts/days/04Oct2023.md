# Wednesday

# 07:29

- I have a good feeling about today

- Based off my learnings and implementation yesterday, I have high hopes that I'll be able to solve all requirements today

# 07:32

- Going to start by getting the matrix profile working properly

# 08:05

- Awesome! Got the matrix profile working.

- Just noticed that when I split the error messages, I'm not getting stacktraces and errors mixed together, even though they should be seperate

# 08:06

- Okay the messages are actually seperated correctly, but they're somehow getting merged back together

# 08:10

- Okay I see, my scripts are working perfectly fine
  
  - It happens when I convert the seperated log_messages into frequency over an interval, this will obviously subdivide the errors into matching segments
  
  - I thought this was duplication but its not

# 08:14

- Getting some breakfast quickly

# 8:55

- I'm back

- Going to start by fixing my kanban

- And then plotting out the matrix profile alongside the source timeseries properly

# 09:43

- Just working through the bugs trying to get this side by side time series and matrix profile plot working

# 10:09

- Wow I just got stuck on such a stupid small bug, does that still happen to you guys I wonder?

# 10:52

- I am just hitting my head against this thing trying to figure out why it's not plotting correctly. All the data is there, but I'm getting weird plots going back to the 1970s. 

- Going to keep cracking at it

# 12:20

- I'm slowly losing my mind, I can tell that there is an x-axis mismatch between the matrix_profile and the frequencies_over_time graphs, but I'm struggling to get the matrix_profile to follow under frequency_over_time

- Fun...

# 12:48

- I FINALL GOT IT WORKING

- Wow. Just needed to explicitly assign the datetime to the matrix, but also have to match the times with the data points, but I've got it working now

- Gonna take a break and focus on getting pattern and anomaly detection working, as those kind of come out the box with a matrix profile

# 13:16

- Didn't end up taking that break, going to take it now

# 14:06

- Cleaning up all the spaghetti I just wrote

# 14:38

- Just finished a little bit of cleanup, more work to be done

- I'm going to switch over to working on the frontend now, need to be able to interact with the system

- Going to make a coffee and start following some quick tutorials on youtube on how to make a next.js page and hook it into a backend api

# 15:17

- Decided to ditch the frontend backend concept for now. It's:
  
  - Out of scope
  
  - I have no prior experience building like this
  
  - I don't have time

- So in light of this, I will just make the app display all the graphs together to work with, probably with a tkinter ui
