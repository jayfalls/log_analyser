# Saturday

# 08:08

- Just fired up my laptop, going to attempt to write all the necessary tests before 9 and potentially implement counting

# 08:28

- Still haven't written any tests, I am busy organising the structure, defining the necessary files and creating functionality to pass a -test flag to the program.

# 08:39

- Just started writting the first test, going to try and get it working properly and outputting to a test.file

- I am considering refactoring the code to raise exceptions rather than print error messages
  
  - I think I'll leave it for now, time is limited

# 09:30

- Wow I went way over time

- But **YAY** I got basic testing working, just need to test and fix any errors I find

# 09:39

- Cool it's working!

- Decided I'm going to work a bit overtime today, since I'm behind schedule

- Gonna get ready for the day, then start writing some more tests

# 09:54

- Okay, just spent some time making sure that test files for the tests are created properly

- Now I'll take a break to get ready

# 11:06

- Fixed some oversights with the testing, still needs more work, but I'm happy with it for now

- Made the start.sh script automatically add -debug and -test parameters as necessary

- Redirected to a temporary testing database when working in debug_mode

# 13:19

- Starting work on the frequency of log type function
- This is where I've created analyser.py
- This script will handle all the frequency, pattern, anomaly, temporal recognition

# 13:30

- I've just been spending this time setting up the analyser component, and adding the COUNT function to sql_log

# 13:33

- I've decided to introduce an interface, as I'm noticing that there is coupling between my components, if I want to start adding more functionality, it's going ti get really bad

# 13:36

- Just created log_analysis_tools.py

# 13:47

- I am currently adding every existing function in my components to the interface  

# 14:14

- It's a lot of work to change over to using an interface, but I'm sure it make a big difference in the long run

# 14:26

- I just started working on the layers of abstraction with the interface, starting with the import_logs function in log_analyser_tools.py

- I'm doing this to understand control flow better, and abstract away complexity to the frontend

# 14:39

- I'm now creating the option to filter the database, this is how we can load as many logs as we want, and then only look between a range of dates, id's, log types and so on and so forth

# 14:48

- I am currently assessing the best way to do this filtering, I'm thinking of injecting the necessary SQL prompts on a per-function basis, with the inject_filter() function serving to give the filters

- The filters will be empty by default, and and only apply injection if the filters exist

# 15:13

- I've just implemented the inject_filters() function, now to just test it and work out the kinks, and fix all the issues I've introduced with the interface

# 15:40

- Just struggling with some errors, working through it

# 16:33

- Got caught up with something in my personal life, I'm back now

# 17:17

- Just finished working through all the bugs I introduced.

- Fully functional again.

- Going to go through code and check for any issues I can still spot

- I'm behind schedule
  
  - With everything I did today, I didn't even get started with the agenda
  
  - But I believe the groundwork I laid will pay dividents to making additionally functionality easier to integrate
  
  - Sometimes delays happen, but that's just engineering. I'm confident that with time I'll get better and more efficient at these tasks.

# 17:21

- I'm thinking of starting work on the frontend GUI tomorrow morning, will have to find time to do tests for the frequency function as well.
- For now I don't have any time left
- Today was not that good for me, but on the bright side I still managed to get something done, not leaving a broken mess for tomorrow me to solve
- **NO MORE MAJOR ARCHITECTURE CHANGES**. I got too sidetracked today on that...

# 17:25

- Signing off.
