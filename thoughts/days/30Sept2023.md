# Saturday

# 08:08

- Just fired up my laptop, going to attempt to write all the necessary tests before 9 and potentially implement counting

# 08:28

- Still haven't written any tests, I am busy organising the structure, defining the necessary files and creating functionality to pass a -test flag to the program.

# 08:39

- Just started writting the first test, going to try and get it working properly and outputting to a test.file

- I am considering refactoring the code to raise exceptions rather than print error messages
  
  - I think I'll leave it for now, time is limited

# 09:30

- Wow I went way over time

- But **YAY** I got basic testing working, just need to test and fix any errors I find

# 09:39

- Cool it's working!

- Decided I'm going to work a bit overtime today, since I'm behind schedule

- Gonna get ready for the day, then start writing some more tests

# 09:54

- Okay, just spent some time making sure that test files for the tests are created properly

- Now I'll take a break to get ready

# 11:06

- Fixed some oversights with the testing, still needs more work, but I'm happy with it for now

- Made the start.sh script automatically add -debug and -test parameters as necessary

- Redirected to a temporary testing database when working in debug_mode
