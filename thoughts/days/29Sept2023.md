# Friday

# 07:38

- Just started my laptop up

- Have a lot of quick adjustments to make based off my ruminations

# 07:42

- Updated the [AGILE](../documents/agile.md) document with some things I forgot yesterday

- Added the [Design Rules](../documents/functional_breakdown/design_rules.md)

# 08:06

- Just finished up with these changes

# 08:11

- Started setting up the kanban board

# 08:26

- Got the board setup and link sharing working

- Just going to populate it real quick

# 09:00

- Just finished up

- Will come back later to start building the program

# 10:36

- Starting a bit early today 

# 10:52

- I am currently assessing the log file structure and semantics

# 11:02

- The log file is really massive, but contains a lot of duplicate records with different times. I'm assuming this is whenever an inference is being called on a camera based on the rules defined by the user

- I'm considering writting a program to seperate all the unique calls to make it a bit easier to understand all the information contained in the log file

- But first I'm just trying to document query the files through a really cool, free AI LLM site ([h20GPT](https://gpt.h2o.ai)) ,with some of the best open source models currently and gpt-3.5

# 11:14

- Got really great insights from [h20GPT](https://gpt.h2o.ai), as detailed here in [Log Structure Analysis](../documents/functional_breakdown/log_structure_analysis.md)

# 11:27

- Broke down all the tasks for log parsing on the [Kanban](https://tree.taiga.io/project/jayfalls-log-analyser)

- Created [Log Structure Analysis](../documents/functional_breakdown/log_structure_analysis.md)
