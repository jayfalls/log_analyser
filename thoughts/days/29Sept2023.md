# Friday

# 07:38

- Just started my laptop up

- Have a lot of quick adjustments to make based off my ruminations

# 07:42

- Updated the [AGILE](../documents/agile.md) document with some things I forgot yesterday

- Added the [Design Rules](../documents/functional_breakdown/design_rules.md)

# 08:06

- Just finished up with these changes

# 08:11

- Started setting up the kanban board

# 08:26

- Got the board setup and link sharing working

- Just going to populate it real quick

# 09:00

- Just finished up

- Will come back later to start building the program

# 10:36

- Starting a bit early today 

# 10:52

- I am currently assessing the log file structure and semantics

# 11:02

- The log file is really massive, but contains a lot of duplicate records with different times. I'm assuming this is whenever an inference is being called on a camera based on the rules defined by the user

- I'm considering writting a program to seperate all the unique calls to make it a bit easier to understand all the information contained in the log file

- But first I'm just trying to document query the files through a really cool, free AI LLM site ([h20GPT](https://gpt.h2o.ai)) ,with some of the best open source models currently and gpt-3.5

# 11:14

- Got really great insights from h20GPT. [h20GPT github](https://github.com/h2oai/h2ogpt), as detailed here in [Log Structure Analysis](../documents/functional_breakdown/log_structure_analysis.md)

# 11:27

- Broke down all the tasks for log parsing on the [Kanban](https://tree.taiga.io/project/jayfalls-log-analyser)

- Created [Log Structure Analysis](../documents/functional_breakdown/log_structure_analysis.md)

# 11:39

- I am now finally starting to build the program, HOORAH! I could not wait to start

- I have broken down, and will continue to as needed, the steps of parsing the log file into its smallest constituites over on the [Kanban](https://tree.taiga.io/project/jayfalls-log-analyser)

# 11:52

- I am currently writting code to load the log file and remove all of the lines where the type is [REPORTING], as I see these are just function calls, they might be relevant for later use cases, but from what I can tell it should not be relevant under the current context. I'll keep my eye open to see if maybe this is a mistake.

- To write this code I'm using h20

# 12:32

- Made the log loader and cleaner an asyncronous function

- Mad a syncronous version out of curiosity, which led me to make speed tests
  
  - Probably not the best use of time, but yeah it's confirmed, the asyncronous version is an order of magnitude faster. Cool
