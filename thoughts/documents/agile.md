# AGILE

# Acceptance Criteria

1. **Simple & Easy:** Must be relatively easy to setup and deploy. Ideally, packed for distribution
2. **Visual:** Must have a gui and graphs
3. **Design Doc:** Must fullfill all requirements laid out by the [Design Document](./design_document.md)

# Continuous Documentation

- Document progress daily, detailing challenges, successes, and optimization ideas.
- Update documentation for each function and solution implemented.

# Build Process

- Focus on getting it to work first, worry about optimisations(Architecture, Big O, etc) later.

- Build it as a backend, not a standalone app.

# Testing

- After finishing each unit in a phase, write out tests for it, this is included in the time for each phase.

# Development Phases

#### Phase 0.5: GUI Frontend (By 6th Oct)

- Build a frontend GUI

- Implement drag & drop functionality

#### Phase 1: Log Parsing and Basic Analysis (By 29th Sept)

- Develop a script in Python to parse the log file.
- Implement log type frequency calculation.

#### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis and Temporal Trends (By 2nd Oct)

- Identify recurring error or warning patterns.
- Analyse temporal trends, e.g., specific errors at certain times/days.

#### Phase 3: Anomaly Detection and Data Visualization (By 5th Oct)

- Implement anomaly detection for unexpected spikes in log frequencies.
- Generate visualisations: log frequency histogram and time series graph.

#### Phase 4: Refinement and Multi-Day Analysis (By 6th Oct)

- Amend the script to handle multiple log files spanning multiple days.
- Optimise the code for efficiency and reliability.
