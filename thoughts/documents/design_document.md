# Design Document

## DEADLINE

6th of October 2023, 5pm.

## Project Goals

Documentation:
Document your journey of building this program along the way. 
Detail the parts you found easy, the parts you found hard, and the parts you failed to do, as well as ideas for optimisation you might have.

## Program Functions

Log Parsing and Basic Analysis:

- Please write a script (preferably in Python) to parse the log file.
- The script should calculate the frequency of each log type (INFO, ERROR, WARNING, DEBUG, etc.).

Advanced Analysis (Diving Deeper):

- Identify patterns of recurring errors or warnings.
- Determine if there are any temporal trends. For example, are certain errors more frequent at specific times of the day or on certain days of the week?
- Check for any anomalies or unexpected spikes in log frequencies.

Visualizations:

- Use a library like Matplotlib or Seaborn in Python to generate graphs visualizing the data.
- A histogram of log frequencies.
- A time series graph showing log counts over time.

Final Touches:

- Amend the script to compare allow for multiple logfiles spanning multiple days
