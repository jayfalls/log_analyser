# Possible Solutions

## Log Analysis

- ### Log Parsing
  
  I have two options I can envision with this:
  
  - Load data into variables that can be written back to json or something similiar
  - Load data into a structered database
  
  Considering that I need to add multi day analysis, I have decided to load everything into a structered sqlite database. This has the added benefit of easily allowing for more variable comparisons of the relationships between data, and achieving a lot of what I would need to code otherwise, with simple sql instructions.

- ### Log Frequency Calculation
  
  I will use the sql FROM and COUNT(*) functions to seperate and count the number of logs in a given log type

- ### Recurring Pattern Identification
  
  Possible approaches provided by Claude 2:
  
  1. **Pattern Matching:**
     
     Use regular expressions or pattern matching algorithms to identify recurring error or warning patterns in the log messages. Define specific patterns or keywords that indicate errors or warnings.
     
     [Pattern Matching Algorithms](./data_analysis_techniques/pm_algorithms.md)
  
  2. **Clustering:**
     
     Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means clustering) to group log entries based on their content or features. This can help identify clusters of log entries that represent similar errors or warnings.

  3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
     
     Utilize NLP techniques to analyze the log messages and extract meaningful information. You can use techniques like topic modeling (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to identify recurring topics or themes related to errors or warnings.

  4. **Time Series Analysis:**
     
     Treat the log data as a time series and apply time series analysis techniques to detect recurring patterns in error or warning occurrences over time.

  5. **Statistical Analysis:**
     
     Use statistical methods (e.g., hypothesis testing, p-values) to identify patterns of recurring errors or warnings. Analyze the distribution and properties of error or warning occurrences.

  6. **Log Message Templates:**
     
     Identify recurring templates or structures in log messages and use them to categorize errors or warnings based on their templates.
