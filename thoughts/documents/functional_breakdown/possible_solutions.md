# Possible Solutions

## LOG ANALYSIS

- ### Log Parsing
  
  I have two options I can envision with this:
  
  - Load data into variables that can be written back to json or something similiar
  - Load data into a structered database
  
  Considering that I need to add multi day analysis, I have decided to load everything into a structered sqlite database. 
  
  This has the added benefit of easily allowing for more variable comparisons of the relationships between data, and achieving a lot of what I would need to code otherwise, with simple sql instructions. 
  
  This also considers the addition of multiple log files, spanning multiple days

- ### Log Frequency Calculation
  
  I will use the sql FROM and COUNT(*) functions to seperate and count the number of logs in a given log type

- ### Recurring Pattern Identification
  
  Possible approaches provided by a gpt:
  
  1. **Pattern Matching:**
     
     Use regular expressions or pattern matching algorithms to identify recurring error or warning patterns in the log messages. Define specific patterns or keywords that indicate errors or warnings.
     
     [Pattern Matching Algorithms](./data_analysis_techniques/pm_algorithms.md)
  
  2. **Clustering:**
     
     Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means clustering) to group log entries based on their content or features. This can help identify clusters of log entries that represent similar errors or warnings.
     
     [Clustering Algorithms](./data_analysis_techniques/clustering_algorithms.md)
  
  3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
     
     Utilize NLP techniques to analyze the log messages and extract meaningful information. You can use techniques like topic modeling (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to identify recurring topics or themes related to errors or warnings.
     
     [NLP Algorithms](./data_analysis_techniques/nlp_algorithms.md)
  
  4. **Time Series Analysis:**
     
     Treat the log data as a time series and apply time series analysis techniques to detect recurring patterns in error or warning occurrences over time.
     
     [Time Series Algorithms](./data_analysis_techniques/time_series_algorithms.md)
  
  5. **Statistical Analysis:**
     
     Use statistical methods (e.g., hypothesis testing, p-values) to identify patterns of recurring errors or warnings. Analyze the distribution and properties of error or warning occurrences.
     
     [Statistic Analysis Algorithms](./data_analysis_techniques/statistic_analysis_algorithms.md)
  
  6. **Log Message Templates:**
     
     Identify recurring templates or structures in log messages and use them to categorize errors or warnings based on their templates.

- ## Temporal Analysis
  
  To determine if there are any temporal trends in log frequencies (e.g., certain errors more frequent at specific times of the day or on certain days of the week), you can implement the following approach:
  
  1. **Time Binning:**
     
     - Divide the time span of your log data into appropriate time bins, for example, hours of the day or days of the week.
  
  2. **Calculate Log Counts for Each Time Bin:**
     
     - Count the occurrences of each log type within each time bin (e.g., hourly or daily log counts).
  
  3. **Aggregate Log Counts:**
     
     - Summarize the log counts for each log type over the specified time bins.
  
  4. **Visualize Temporal Trends:**
     
     - Use appropriate visualization techniques (e.g., line plots, bar plots) to display the log counts for each log type over time (e.g., hours, days).
  
  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import pandas as pd
  
  # Load your log data into a DataFrame (assuming log_data is a DataFrame with columns 'timestamp' and 'log_type')
  # Ensure 'timestamp' is in datetime format
  # log_data = ... 
  
  # Set the time binning interval (e.g., hourly, daily)
  time_bin_interval = 'H'  # Hourly binning
  
  # Group log data by the time bins and log type, then count occurrences
  log_counts = log_data.groupby([pd.Grouper(key='timestamp', freq=time_bin_interval), 'log_type']).size().unstack().fillna(0)
  
  # Plot temporal trends for each log type
  log_counts.plot(kind='line', figsize=(10, 6))
  plt.xlabel('Time')
  plt.ylabel('Log Count')
  plt.title('Log Counts Over Time')
  plt.legend(title='Log Type', title_fontsize='12', fontsize='10', loc='upper right')
  plt.show()
  ```
  
  In this pseudocode, we use pandas to aggregate log counts within specified time bins (e.g., hourly) and visualize the log counts over time for each log type. Adjust the `time_bin_interval` variable according to your analysis requirements (e.g., hourly, daily). The resulting plot will show how log counts vary over time for different log types, allowing you to identify any temporal trends.
  
  ## Anomaly/Outlier Identification
  
  1. **Moving Average:**
     
     - Calculate a moving average of log frequencies over a certain time window. Sudden deviations from the moving average may indicate anomalies.
  
  2. **Standard Deviation Method:**
     
     - Calculate the standard deviation of log frequencies and identify log counts that deviate significantly from the mean as potential anomalies.
  
  3. **Z-Score:**
     
     - Compute the Z-score for log counts, highlighting values that fall outside a specified Z-score threshold as potential anomalies.
  
  4. **Seasonal Decomposition:**
     
     - Use seasonal decomposition to separate the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Anomalies may manifest in the residual component.
  
  5. **Time Series Decomposition:**
     
     - Decompose the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Anomalies may be detected in the residual component.
  
  6. **Density-Based Outlier Detection:**
     
     - Utilize density-based clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN) to identify regions of varying data density, potentially indicating anomalies.
  
  7. **Isolation Forest:**
     
     - Apply the Isolation Forest algorithm, which isolates anomalies by building an ensemble of decision trees.
  
  8. **Twitter's Anomaly Detection Algorithm (ADTK):**
     
     - Leverage the ADTK library, which offers various statistical and machine learning-based anomaly detection methods.
  
  9. **CUSUM (Cumulative Sum) Algorithm:**
     
     - Use CUSUM to monitor deviations in log frequencies and trigger an alert when the deviation exceeds a certain threshold.
  
  10. **Exponential Smoothing:**
      
      - Apply exponential smoothing techniques to smooth the time series and identify anomalies as significant deviations from the smoothed values.
  
  11. **Machine Learning-Based Approaches:**
      
      - Train a machine learning model (e.g., isolation forest, one-class SVM) to classify log frequencies as normal or anomalous based on historical data.
