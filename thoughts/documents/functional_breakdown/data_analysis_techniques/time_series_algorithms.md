# Time Series Algorithms

1. **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA):**
   
   - A popular statistical method for time series forecasting and analysis.

2. **Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL):**
   
   - A method to decompose a time series into its seasonal, trend, and remainder components for further analysis.

3. **Prophet:**
   
   - An open-source forecasting tool by Facebook suitable for time series data with strong seasonal effects and missing data.

4. **Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average (SARIMA):**
   
   - An extension of ARIMA that includes seasonal components, suitable for time series data with seasonal patterns.

5. **Exponential Smoothing State Space Model (ETS):**
   
   - A method that models time series data using error, trend, and seasonality components.

6. **Vector Autoregression (VAR):**
   
   - A multivariate time series analysis method that models the dependencies between multiple time series variables.

7. **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):**
   
   - A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of modeling long-term dependencies in time series data.

8. **Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (HWES):**
   
   - A method that considers trend, seasonality, and error components to forecast time series data.

9. **Dynamic Harmonic Regression (DHR):**
   
   - A method that combines harmonic regression with an ARIMA or ETS model to handle seasonal time series.

10. **Fourier Transform:**
    
    - A mathematical technique to transform time series data into its frequency domain, allowing the analysis of periodic patterns.

11. **Wavelet Transform:**
    
    - A technique that breaks down time series data into different frequency components, enabling the identification of patterns at different scales.

12. **Autoencoder:**
    
    - A neural network technique used for dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection in time series data.
