# Statistic Analysis Algorithms

1. **Hypothesis Testing:**
   
   - A framework for making decisions or inferences about a population based on sample data.

2. **t-Test:**
   
   - A statistical test used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups.

3. **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):**
   
   - A statistical technique for comparing means across multiple groups to assess if there are significant differences.

4. **Chi-Square Test:**
   
   - A test used to determine if there is a significant association between categorical variables in a contingency table.

5. **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test:**
   
   - A non-parametric test to determine if two samples come from the same distribution.

6. **Mann-Whitney U Test:**
   
   - A non-parametric test for determining if there is a significant difference between two independent samples.

7. **Kruskal-Wallis Test:**
   
   - A non-parametric test to determine if there are significant differences between multiple independent groups.

8. **Regression Analysis:**
   
   - Analyzing the relationship between variables, often used to predict outcomes based on predictor variables.

9. **Correlation Analysis:**
   
   - Analyzing the strength and direction of the relationship between two continuous variables.

10. **Time Series Analysis:**
    
    - Techniques such as autocorrelation analysis to assess patterns and relationships within a time series.

11. **Outlier Detection:**
    
    - Identifying unusual or abnormal observations in the data that deviate significantly from the norm.

12. **Goodness-of-Fit Tests:**
    
    - Evaluating whether the observed data follows a particular theoretical distribution (e.g., normal distribution).

13. **Poisson Regression:**
    
    - Analyzing count data to model the rate of occurrence of events.
