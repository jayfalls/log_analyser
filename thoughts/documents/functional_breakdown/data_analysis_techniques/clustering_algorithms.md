# Clustering Algorithms

1. **K-means Clustering:**
   
   - A widely used centroid-based clustering algorithm that partitions data into K clusters based on their mean features.

2. **Hierarchical Clustering:**
   
   - Forms a tree of clusters (dendrogram) by iteratively merging or splitting data points based on their similarity or distance.

3. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):**
   
   - Clusters data based on density, where regions with many data points are considered clusters and areas with fewer points are considered noise.

4. **Agglomerative Clustering:**
   
   - Starts with each data point as a separate cluster and merges them based on a distance metric until only one cluster remains.

5. **Mean Shift Clustering:**
   
   - Assigns each data point to the nearest mode of the data distribution, often used for image segmentation.

6. **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM):**
   
   - Models data as a mixture of several Gaussian distributions, each representing a cluster.

7. **Spectral Clustering:**
   
   - Uses the eigenvalues of a similarity matrix to reduce the dimensionality of the data and then applies K-means or other clustering algorithms.

8. **Affinity Propagation:**
   
   - Clusters data by sending messages between pairs of data points until a set of exemplars (representative points) is identified.

9. **OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure):**
   
   - Similar to DBSCAN but provides a more flexible clustering structure, allowing for clusters of varying densities.

10. **Fuzzy C-means (FCM):**
    
    - An extension of K-means where each data point is assigned a degree of membership to each cluster, allowing for soft clustering.

11. **BIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering Using Hierarchies):**
    
    - Constructs a tree-like data structure to perform clustering efficiently on large datasets.

12. **Agglomerative Nesting:**
    
    - A hierarchical clustering method that builds nested clusters by merging smaller clusters into larger ones.

13. **X-means Clustering:**
    
    - An extension of K-means that determines the optimal number of clusters using a Bayesian information criterion.
