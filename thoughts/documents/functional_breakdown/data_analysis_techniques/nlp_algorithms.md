# Natural Language Processing Algorithms

1. **Tokenization:**
   
   - The process of breaking text into words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful elements, known as tokens.

2. **Stopword Removal:**
   
   - Eliminating common words (e.g., 'and', 'the') that do not convey significant meaning in the analysis process.

3. **Stemming or Lemmatization:**
   
   - Reducing words to their base or root form, aiding in analysis by treating variant forms of a word as the same.

4. **Named Entity Recognition (NER):**
   
   - Identifying and categorizing named entities (e.g., names, locations, organizations) in text for further analysis.

5. **Topic Modeling (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation - LDA):**
   
   - A method to uncover abstract topics within a collection of text documents, allowing for insights into recurring themes or subjects.
