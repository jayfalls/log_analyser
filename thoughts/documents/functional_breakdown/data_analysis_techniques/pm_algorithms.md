# Pattern Matching Algorithms

1. **Regular Expressions (Regex):**
   
   - Regular expressions are a powerful tool for pattern matching in strings. They allow you to define specific patterns using a sequence of characters and special symbols.
   - Example: Matching email addresses, phone numbers, or specific words in a text.

2. **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm:**
   
   - KMP is used to search for a word (pattern) within a longer text (string) by efficiently avoiding unnecessary character comparisons.
   - Example: Searching for a word in a large document.

3. **Boyer-Moore Algorithm:**
   
   - Boyer-Moore is a highly efficient string searching algorithm that skips comparisons based on a preprocessing step that uses information from the pattern.
   - Example: Searching for a word in a large document.

4. **Rabin-Karp Algorithm:**
   
   - Rabin-Karp uses hashing to compare patterns with the text efficiently. It computes the hash of the pattern and compares it with the hash of each substring in the text.
   - Example: Searching for a pattern within a text.

5. **Aho-Corasick Algorithm:**
   
   - Aho-Corasick constructs a finite state machine that efficiently searches for multiple patterns simultaneously in a text.
   - Example: Searching for multiple keywords in a document.

6. **Trie (Prefix Tree):**
   
   - A trie is a tree-like data structure used for efficient pattern matching, particularly for strings and sequences of characters.
   - Example: Storing a dictionary or autocomplete suggestions.

7. **Levenshtein Distance:**
   
   - Levenshtein distance measures the difference (or similarity) between two strings by counting the minimum number of single-character edits required to change one string into the other.
   - Example: Spell checking, DNA sequence comparison.

8. **Wu-Manber Algorithm:**
   
   - Wu-Manber is a multiple pattern string matching algorithm that uses a combination of hashing and shift-or operations for efficient pattern matching.
   - Example: Searching for multiple patterns in a text.
