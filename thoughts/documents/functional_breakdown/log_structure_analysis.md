# Log Structure Analysis

Based on the information provided in the context, here are the key insights and table points that can be gathered:

1. Log Entries:
   
   - Each log entry starts with a unique identifier (e.g., "daddd921-00f0-4f6d-9afc-ed505c5c3707:infra-api-us-east1-c").
   - The log entries contain timestamps indicating when the events occurred.
   - The log entries include different types of log messages, such as [ERROR] and [STACKTRACE].

2. Error Messages:
   
   - The log entries contain error messages related to failed connections to a rabbit queue.
   - The error messages mention the node ID associated with the failed connection.
   - Some error messages indicate that a specific queue was not found in the virtual host.

3. Stack Traces:
   
   - The log entries also include stack traces related to certain events.
   - Stack traces provide additional information about the error or exception that occurred.
   - Some stack traces mention the absence of a specific queue in the virtual host.

4. Timestamps:
   
   - The timestamps in the log entries indicate the date and time of each event.
   - The timestamps can be used for time analysis, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition.

To extract this information into a database for further analysis, you can consider creating a table with the following columns:

- `log_id`: Identifier for where the log comes from.
- `log_type`: Type of log message (e.g., [ERROR], [STACKTRACE]).
- `source`: Sourch repository/module/function that the log comes from
- `date`: Date of the event.
- `time`: Time of the event.
- `message`: Detailed error message or stack trace.
