# Tokenisation Implementation

You'll tokenize the log messages to extract individual words or phrases. You can split the log messages based on spaces or other delimiters to create a list of tokens for each log entry.

## Frequency Analysis

Once you have the tokens, you can perform frequency analysis to identify the most commonly occurring words or phrases. You can count the occurrences of each token and sort them in descending order to find the most frequent ones.

## Identifying Recurring Patterns

Based on the frequency analysis, you can identify recurring patterns by looking for clusters of frequently occurring tokens. You can set a threshold for the minimum number of occurrences to filter out infrequent tokens and focus on the most significant ones.

## Visualization

To gain insights from the identified recurring patterns, you can visualize them using various charts or graphs. For example, you can create a bar chart to display the top N most frequent tokens or a word cloud to visually represent the distribution of tokens.
