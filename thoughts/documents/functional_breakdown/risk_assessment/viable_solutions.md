# Viable Solutions

This will filter out the methods that I will not use, the list of viable candidate solutions is:

- ### [Clustering Algorithms](./data_analysis_techniques/clustering_algorithms.md)
  
  - ## DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):
    
    - **Suitability**
      
      DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that can effectively identify clusters of varying shapes and sizes. It is well-suited for detecting recurring patterns of errors or warnings, as it can group data points based on their density.
    
    - **Pros**
      
      - Automatically discovers clusters without requiring the number of clusters to be pre-specified.
      
      - Can handle noise points effectively, which is useful for identifying sporadic or isolated errors.
      
      - Can capture clusters of arbitrary shapes.
    
    - **Cons**
      
      - Requires tuning of density parameters such as the neighborhood radius and the minimum number of points within the radius.
      
      - Sensitive to the density parameter values, which may require some experimentation or domain knowledge.
      
      - May struggle with high-dimensional data due to the curse of dimensionality.
  
  - ## Hierarchical Clustering:
    
    - **Suitability**
      
      Hierarchical clustering builds a tree-like structure that can be useful for identifying nested clusters or patterns in the log data. It can handle a wide range of data types and is suitable for identifying recurring error or warning patterns.
    
    - **Pros**
      
      - Provides a hierarchical representation of the data, allowing for the identification of nested clusters or patterns.
      
      - Does not require specifying the number of clusters in advance.
      
      - Can handle different similarity or distance measures.
    
    - **Cons**
      
      - Can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.
      
      - Not suitable for handling very high-dimensional data.
      
      - The choice of distance metric and linkage method can impact the results.

- ### [NLP Algorithms](./data_analysis_techniques/nlp_algorithms.md)
  
  - ## Tokenization
    
    - **Pros**
      
      - Enables easy identification of frequently occurring words or phrases.
      
      - Provides a foundation for other text analysis techniques.
    
    - **Cons**
      
      - May not capture the full context of log messages if the meaning relies on the order or combination of words.
      
      - Ignores the grammatical structure and relationships between words.
  
  - ## Stemming or Lemmatization:
    
    - **Pros**
      
      - Reduces the dimensionality of the data by collapsing words to their root forms.
      
      - Helps in identifying patterns by grouping similar words together.
    
    - **Cons**
      
      - Stemming and lemmatization algorithms may not always produce accurate results, leading to incorrect grouping of words.
      
      - Losing the original word form can sometimes impact the interpretability of the analysis results.

- ### [Time Series Algorithms](./data_analysis_techniques/time_series_algorithms.md)
  
  - ## Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average (SARIMA):
    
    - **Reasoning**
      
      SARIMA is an extension of ARIMA that incorporates seasonal components. It is particularly useful when there are recurring patterns or seasonality in the data, which is often the case for logs that exhibit periodic errors or warnings. By considering both the non-seasonal and seasonal aspects of the data, SARIMA can effectively capture and model recurring errors or warnings.
    
    - **Pros**
      
      - SARIMA can handle both non-seasonal and seasonal patterns in the data.
      
      - It provides flexibility in modeling different types of time series behaviors.
      
      - SARIMA offers statistical measures for evaluating model fit and performance.
    
    - **Cons**
      
      - SARIMA assumes that the data is stationary, which may not always hold true for log data.
      
      - It requires careful selection of model parameters, including the order of differencing, autoregressive, moving average, and seasonal components.
      
      - SARIMA may struggle with long-term dependencies or nonlinear patterns in the data.
