# Chosen Solution

1. **Pattern Identification**: Once the data is preprocessed, you can use various techniques to identify patterns of recurring errors or warnings. Based on your considerations, the viable candidates are clustering algorithms, NLP algorithms, and time series algorithms.
   
   - **Clustering Algorithms**: Clustering algorithms like DBSCAN and hierarchical clustering can group similar log messages together based on their characteristics. They can be effective for identifying recurring patterns. You can implement these algorithms using Python libraries like `scikit-learn` or `scipy`.
   
   - **NLP Algorithms**: NLP techniques like tokenization, stemming, or lemmatization can help identify frequently occurring words or phrases in the log messages. These techniques can provide insights into common error patterns. Python libraries such as `NLTK` or `spaCy` can be used for NLP processing.
   
   - **Time Series Algorithms**: If your log data has a temporal component, time series algorithms like SARIMA can capture recurring patterns over time. SARIMA is particularly useful when there are seasonal or periodic errors or warnings. You can implement SARIMA using Python libraries such as `statsmodels` or `pmdarima`.

2. **Evaluation and Visualization**: After applying the analysis techniques, it's important to evaluate the results and visualize the identified patterns. This step helps in understanding the significance of the recurring errors or warnings and communicating the findings to stakeholders. Python libraries like `matplotlib` or `seaborn` can be used for data visualization.

# Tokenisation as a Pre Step

Considering the easiest solution to implement, **tokenization** using NLP algorithms can be a good starting point. Tokenization is relatively straightforward and can provide insights into frequently occurring words or phrases in the log messages. It requires minimal preprocessing and can be implemented using Python libraries like `NLTK` or `spaCy`. Once you have the tokens, you can count their occurrences and identify recurring patterns.
