# Game Plan

## AGILE

I will use the agile framework, adapted to solo development, to produce as high quality code as possible in as short as possible time.

*This includes*:

- Define all objectives

- Prioritise the most important aspects first

- Short development loops focusing on the smallest possible components

- Focus on building tests after each component

- Use a kanban to monitor progress

## Schedule

- I will assign a working period of 5 hours a day maximum. 
  
  - Between 12:00pm to17:00pm

- I will spend up to an hour every morning before 09:00am to finish previous day spillover and to mitigate gathering debt from incomplete tasks

- Deadlines will be partially flexible, as I have never built anything like this before, as well as to account for weird bugs and frustrations

- I will set a personal deadline for next week Monday
